/**
 * Generates implementations for the {@code equals} and {@code hashCode} methods inherited by all objects.
 * <p/>
 * If either method already exists, then {@code @EqualsAndHashCode} will not generate that particular method.
 * If they all exist, {@code @EqualsAndHashCode} generates no methods, and emits a warning instead to highlight
 * that its doing nothing at all. The parameter list and return type are not relevant when deciding to skip generation of
 * a method; any method named {@code hashCode} will make {@code @EqualsAndHashCode} not generate that method,
 * for example.
 * <p/>
 * By default, all fields that are non-static and non-transient are used in the equality check and hashCode generation.
 * You can exclude more fields by specifying them in the {@code exclude} parameter. You can also explicitly specify
 * the fields that are to be used by specifying them in the {@code of} parameter.
 * <p/>
 * Normally, auto-generating {@code hashCode} and {@code equals} implementations in a subclass is a bad idea, as
 * the superclass also defines fields, for which equality checks/hashcodes won't be auto-generated. Therefore, a warning
 * is emitted when you try. Instead, you can set the {@code callSuper} parameter to <em>true</em> which will call
 * {@code super.equals} and {@code super.hashCode}. Doing this with {@code java.lang.Object} as superclass is
 * pointless, so, conversely, setting this flag when <em>NOT</em> extending something (other than Object) will also generate
 * a warning. Be aware that not all implementations of {@code equals} correctly handle being called from a subclass!
 * Fortunately, lombok-generated {@code equals} implementations do correctly handle it.
 * <p/>
 * Array fields are handled by way of {@link java.util.Arrays#deepEquals(Object[], Object[])} where necessary, as well
 * as {@code deepHashCode}. The downside is that arrays with circular references (arrays that contain themselves,
 * possibly indirectly) results in calls to {@code hashCode} and {@code equals} throwing a
 * {@link StackOverflowError}. However, the implementations for java's own {@link java.util.ArrayList} suffer
 * from the same flaw.
