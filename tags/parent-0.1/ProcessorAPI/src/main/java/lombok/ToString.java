/**
 * Generates an implementation for the {@code toString} method inherited by all objects.
 * <p/>
 * If the method already exists, then {@code ToString} will not generate any method, and instead warns
 * that it's doing nothing at all. The parameter list and return type are not relevant when deciding to skip generation of
 * the method; any method named {@code toString} will make {@code ToString} not generate anything.
 * <p/>
 * By default, all fields that are non-static are used in the toString generation. You can exclude fields by specifying them
 * in the {@code exclude} parameter. You can also explicitly specify the fields that
 * are to be used by specifying them in the {@code of} parameter.
 * <p/>
 * Array fields are handled by way of {@link java.util.Arrays#deepToString(Object[])} where necessary.
 * The downside is that arrays with circular references (arrays that contain themselves,
 * possibly indirectly) results in calls to {@code toString} throwing a
 * {@link StackOverflowError}. However, the implementations for java's own {@link java.util.ArrayList} suffer
 * from the same flaw.
 * <p/>
 * The {@code toString} method that is generated will print the class name as well as each field (both the name
 * and the value). You can optionally choose to suppress the printing of the field name, by setting the
 * {@code includeFieldNames} flag to <em>false</em>.
 * <p/>
 * You can also choose to include the result of {@code toString} in your class's superclass by setting the
 * {@code callSuper} to <em>true</em>.
