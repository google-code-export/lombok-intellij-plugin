/**
 * &#64;SneakyThrow will avoid javac's insistence that you either catch or throw onward any checked exceptions that
 * statements in your method body declare they generate.
 * <p/>
 * &#64;SneakyThrow does not silently swallow, wrap into RuntimeException, or otherwise modify any exceptions of the listed
 * checked exception types. The JVM does not check for the consistency of the checked exception system; javac does,
 * and this annotation lets you opt out of its mechanism.
 * <p/>
 * You should use this annotation ONLY in the following two cases:<ol>
 * <li>You are certain the listed exception can't actually ever happen, or only in vanishingly rare situations.
 * You don't try to catch OutOfMemoryError on every statement either. Examples:<br>
 * {@code IOException} in {@code ByteArrayOutputStream}<br>
 * {@code UnsupportedEncodingException} in new String(byteArray, "UTF-8").</li>
 * <li>You know for certain the caller can handle the exception (for example, because the caller is
 * an app manager that will handle all throwables that fall out of your method the same way), but due
 * to interface restrictions you can't just add these exceptions to your 'throws' clause.
 * <p/>
 * Note that, as SneakyThrow is an implementation detail and <i>NOT</i> part of your method signature, it is
 * a compile time error if none of the statements in your method body can throw a listed exception.
 * <p/>
 * <b><i>WARNING: </b></i>You must have lombok.jar available at the runtime of your app if you use SneakyThrows,
 * because your code is rewritten to use {@link Lombok#sneakyThrow(Throwable)}.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * &#64;SneakyThrows(UnsupportedEncodingException.class)
 * public void utf8ToString(byte[] bytes) {
 *     return new String(bytes, "UTF-8");
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * {@code @SneakyThrows} without a parameter defaults to allowing <i>every</i> checked exception.
 * (The default is {@code Throwable.class}).
 *
 * @see Lombok#sneakyThrow(Throwable)
