/**
 * Put on any field to make lombok build a standard setter.
 * <p/>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 *     private &#64;Setter int foo;
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * will generate:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *     public void setFoo(int foo) {
 *         this.foo = foo;
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * If any method named {@code setFoo} exists, regardless of return type or parameters, no method is generated,
 * and instead a compiler warning is emitted.
 * <p/>
 * This annotation can also be applied to a class, in which case it'll be as if all non-static fields that don't already have
 * a {@code Setter} annotation have the annotation.
