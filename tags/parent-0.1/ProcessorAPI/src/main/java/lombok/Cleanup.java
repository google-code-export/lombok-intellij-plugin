/**
 * Ensures the variable declaration that you annotate will be cleaned up by calling its close method, regardless
 * of what happens. Implemented by wrapping all statements following the local variable declaration to the
 * end of your scope into a try block that, as a finally action, closes the resource.
 * <p/>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * public void copyFile(String in, String out) throws IOException {
 *     &#64;Cleanup FileInputStream inStream = new FileInputStream(in);
 *     &#64;Cleanup FileOutputStream outStream = new FileOutputStream(out);
 *     byte[] b = new byte[65536];
 *     while (true) {
 *         int r = inStream.read(b);
 *         if (r == -1) break;
 *         outStream.write(b, 0, r);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * Will generate:
 * <pre>
 * public void copyFile(String in, String out) throws IOException {
 *     &#64;Cleanup FileInputStream inStream = new FileInputStream(in);
 *     try {
 *         &#64;Cleanup FileOutputStream outStream = new FileOutputStream(out);
 *         try {
 *             byte[] b = new byte[65536];
 *             while (true) {
 *                 int r = inStream.read(b);
 *                 if (r == -1) break;
 *                 outStream.write(b, 0, r);
 *             }
 *         } finally {
 *             out.close();
 *         }
 *     } finally {
 *         in.close();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * Note that the final close method call, if it throws an exception, will overwrite any exception thrown
 * in the main body of the generated try block. You should NOT rely on this behaviour - future versions of
 * lombok intend to silently swallow any exception thrown by the cleanup method <i>_IF</i> the main body
 * throws an exception as well, as the earlier exception is usually far more useful.
 * <p/>
 * However, in java 1.6, generating the code to do this is prohibitively complicated.
