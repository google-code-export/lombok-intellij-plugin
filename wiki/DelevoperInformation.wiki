== Project setup==

 # Project setup contains maven and IntelliJ project files
 # You will need to setup you developer configuration in the main maven pom.xml first, just copy existing config of another developer and change you local paths and properties.
 # Run mvn install, to be sure a build is fine and let maven download and install some libs (dependencies of plugin)
