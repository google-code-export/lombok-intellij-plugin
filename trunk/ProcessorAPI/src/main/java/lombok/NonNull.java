/**
 * Lombok is smart enough to translate any annotation named {@code @NonNull} or {@code @NotNull} in any casing and
 * with any package name to the return type of generated getters and the parameter of generated setters and constructors,
 * as well as generate the appropriate null checks in the setter and constructor.
 * <p/>
 * You can use this annotation for the purpose, though you can also use JSR305's annotation, findbugs's, pmd's, or IDEA's, or just
 * about anyone elses. As long as it is named {@code @NonNull} or {@code @NotNull}.
 * <p/>
 * WARNING: If the java community ever does decide on supporting a single {@code @NonNull} annotation (for example via JSR305), then
 * this annotation will <strong>be deleted</strong> from the lombok package. If the need to update an import statement scares
 * you, you should use your own annotation named {@code @NonNull} instead of this one.
