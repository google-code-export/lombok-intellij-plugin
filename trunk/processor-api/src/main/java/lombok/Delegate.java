 * <p/>
 * will generate for example an {@code boolean add(String)} method, which contains: {@code return foo.add(arg);}, as well as all other methods in {@code List}.

   * type arguments can only be done as a field type. A solution for this is to create a private inner interface/class with the appropriate types extended, and possibly
   * with all methods you'd like to delegate listed, and then supply that class here. The field does not actually have to implement the type you're delegating; the
   * type listed here is used only to determine which delegate methods to generate.
